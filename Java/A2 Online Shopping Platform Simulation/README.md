# A2: Online Shopping Platform Simulation

## Scenario
You are developing the core logic of a console-based shopping system for an online store. The store sells various types of items (e.g., electronics, groceries, clothes) and supports both regular and discounted sales. You will model the entities using object-oriented principles, focusing on polymorphism, inheritance, casting, and abstraction.


## Learning Objectives

 -  Implement polymorphism and late binding
-   Apply abstract classes and abstract methods
-   Use the final modifier to protect methods/classes
-   Practice upcasting and downcasting with safety checks
-   Override toString() for user-friendly output
-   Write clean, modular, reusable Java code

## Class Application
 -  Object-Ortiented Programming II
