# A3: Exception-Proof Online Shopping System

## Scenario
You’re tasked with developing a console-based online shopping system for a fictional store called SmartCart. This application allows users to browse a few predefined products, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout. However, it must handle all kinds of user input errors and business rule violations using Java’s exception handling mechanisms.


## Learning Objectives

-   Apply try-catch  blocks and exception-controlled loops.
-   Use built-in exceptions like InputMismatchException.
-   Throw custom exceptions for business logic (e.g., InsufficientBalanceException,  EmptyCartException).
-   Use throws  clause in methods that propagate exceptions.
-   Build and use multiple classes to organize logic.
