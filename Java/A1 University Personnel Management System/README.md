# A1: University Personnel Management System 

## Scenario
Youâ€™ve been hired by the IT department of a university to help model their personnel system. The goal is to capture the shared and unique characteristics of students, faculty, and staff, while maintaining a clean and extensible object-oriented design. You must design and implement an inheritance-based solution that clearly distinguishes between shared and role-specific behavior. Proper use of constructors, field encapsulation, and method overriding is required.


## Learning Objectives

 - Design class hierarchies from a real-world domain. 
 - Apply **inheritance, constructor chaining (super), and method overriding**.
 - Implement field comparison and identity logic using equals().
 - Practice toString() for user-friendly object printing.
 - Strengthen responsibility in program design and in-person communication.
